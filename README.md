# SimpleNeuralNetwork
Simple constructor of multi-layer neural networks. Sigmoid activation function. Backpropagation.

Despite the many successful applications of back propagation, it is not a universal solution. What causes most trouble is an indefinitely long learning process. In complex tasks, it can take days or even weeks for the network to learn, and it may not learn at all.
